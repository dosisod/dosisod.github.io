# Thoughts On AI

Last night I watched *The Creator*, and on the ride home my dad and I talked about
some of the future implications of AI. Afterwards I thought some more, and decided it
would be fun to jot down some of my feelings towards AI as a whole.

These are in no way "new" thoughts - most of it has been said in one way or another -
but alas I want to ramble and put my ideas out there.

In no particular order...

* The line between "algorithm" and "AI" is hard to determine, and is often conflated.

* AI can, is, and will be used to fabricate evidence.

* The potential for evidence to be fabricated using AI will be used to cast doubt on actual evidence.

* "AI" is not one singular thing, but a loose term that can be applied to any "highly complex" algorithm.

* Regulating AI is hard, if not impossible.

* We (the consumers) were responsible for freely feeding and training these AI systems.

* We (the consumers) are responsible for using/paying for/supporting companies that don't harm us going forwards.

* AI systems that aren't connected to the internet (or robots with arms and legs) can't take over the world.

* AI systems that aren't connected to the internet can still cause serious harm (spam, blackmail, deepfakes, etc).

* AI makes it hard to know what you're seeing online is real or fake.

* Not using AI or LLMs for your writing gives you FOMO for those who are.

* When it comes to writing, AI/LLMs are becoming the lowest common denominator in regards to grammar, spelling, and so forth.

* The proclaimed benefiets of AI makes others get suckered into adopting it.

* AI itself is not a problem, it's the people who make it that we need to worry about.

* Who's really asking for AI?

* AI does not mark the end of algorithms, it's just another algorithm.

* AI is not always the right tool for the job.

* Sometimes AI is the most incorrect, dangerous, and idiotic tool for the job.

* Many AI systems are highly unoptimized and inefficient.

* Rampant adoption of AI (especially inefficient AI systems) will significant increase global power usage.

* Rampant adoption of AI will significant increase globalization.

* AI should make you question what it means to be human.

* AI generated music will probably become mainstream.

* You cannot rely on AI to secure itself, you need external checks and balances.

* AI is scary.

* AI is mysterious.

* AI is going to be in the news for a while.
