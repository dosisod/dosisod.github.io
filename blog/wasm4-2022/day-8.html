<br>
<p>I&#x27;ve been dealing with head gasket repairs and haven&#x27;t really had time to work on the
jam (blog on that later, perhaps). Today I mustered up the energy to keep
going, especially given that there is about 1.5 days left before everything has
to be submitted.</p>
<br>
<p>Some milestones:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Code has been uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/dosisod/matcha9000">GitHub</a>!</li>
<li>A GitHub action workflow has been added to create a release (with build artifacts) whenever a commit is made to master.</li>
<li>Auto saving current level</li>
<li>Hashed out the first 5 levels</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>One of the hardest things that I have ran into is making the levels hard enough to be fun,
but easy enough to be solvable, and fit within the 20 line mark. I have a few ideas to make
things easier/more playable, including:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Making the <code class="hljs">ROT</code> op code take a turn count</li>
<li>Make <code class="hljs">USE</code> op code work regardless of player direction</li>
<li>Add a play/pause button to allow you to stop/resume normal execution</li>
<li>Add sort of a grid system to make counting out steps easier</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>I have a lot of work ahead of me tomorrow. I was planning on making 20 levels to match the
20 available instructions, but that might be hard, especially with the game play adjustments I need
to make.</p>
