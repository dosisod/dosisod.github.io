<br>
<p>Much progress was made today! With 5 days left though, I don&#x27;t know if I will be able
to deliver everything that I want, but we will see.</p>
<br>
<p>Most of today was spent doing cleanup, and adding more display elements. In particular, I:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Added lasers</li>
<li>A big <code class="hljs">X</code> over the operators that haven&#x27;t been unlocked yet</li>
<li>An status bar for the number of coins needed to open the exit</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>I am currently struggling with &quot;making it look good&quot; and &quot;making it work&quot;. They both need
to happen, but I cannot do both at once. There are a lot of big features which I still
need to add, so we will see how things go.</p>
<br>
<a id="proof" href="#proof"><h2>Proof</h2></a>

<br>
<br>
<p>I was planning on adding a lot levels today, but that is sorta hard when the features
of the game haven&#x27;t been implemented. I spent a lot of today doing that, so hopefully
that will be what I do tomorrow.</p>
