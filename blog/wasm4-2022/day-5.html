<br>
<p>I&#x27;ve made more progress today then any other day so far! Things are starting to all come
together, and <em>now</em> I am at the point where I can actually start building some really
cool levels.</p>
<br>
<p>Some of the things I did today:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Make lasers actually kill you</li>
<li>Allow for buttons to disable lasers</li>
<li>Add a cool wavy coin animation</li>
<li>Add the display for the accumulator</li>
<li>Add menu with <code class="hljs">+</code>/<code class="hljs">-</code> buttons for the op codes that have an argument</li>
<li>Add sound!</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>The sounds where a lot easier to add then I anticipated, and I feel like I could add
in a few more sounds here really quickly.</p>

<blockquote>Level 0 is my testing/development level. It also acts as a buffer to allow my to use
1-based indexing for the levels array :)</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Tomorrow I hope to upload my code so far to GitHub. It is as good as it is going to
be (cleanliness-wise), no point in trying to clean it up more. Maybe after the game
jam I will.</p>
