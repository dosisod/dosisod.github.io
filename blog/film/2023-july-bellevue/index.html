<br>
<p>A few weeks ago me and my friend went to Bellevue to do some urban shots with our
film cameras. I am new to film photography, and was using a second-hand camera that
I got for free from a friend, so suffice to say, I had no idea what I was doing.</p>
<br>
<p>I&#x27;ve used a DSLR before, but have never used film. I basically put it into auto
mode, went shooting, and hoped for the best. Here&#x27;s what I got.</p>
<br>
<p>Shooting with Ektar 100 color film. Images are downscaled to reduce bandwidth, and
to keep people from stealing my pictures.</p>
<br>
<a id="1" href="#1"><h2>1</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./1.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>A nice shot of a building with some cool, angular looking windows.</p>
<br>
<a id="2" href="#2"><h2>2</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./2.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>I liked the black and white parts of this building, and that it had very harsh sticky-out
bits. Also vines.</p>
<br>
<p>I took a whole lot of vertical shots because they kinda just felt right. Don&#x27;t judge me.</p>
<br>
<a id="3" href="#3"><h2>3</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./3.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>Same as the last shot, but horizontal.</p>
<br>
<a id="4" href="#4"><h2>4</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./4.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>This looked a lot cooler in my head.</p>
<br>
<a id="5" href="#5"><h2>5</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./5.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>I like the vibe of this photo, but my poor friend is hard to see. Other than that I like it.</p>
<br>
<a id="6" href="#6"><h2>6</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./6.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>A lot going on in this one, but I like it.</p>
<br>
<a id="7" href="#7"><h2>7</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./7.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>I don&#x27;t like this one.</p>
<br>
<a id="8" href="#8"><h2>8</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./8.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>I didn&#x27;t notice until someone pointed it out, but there are 2 hands in this picture.</p>
<br>
<p>Also, I like the texture of the building in the background, reminds me of waffle shirts.</p>
<br>
<a id="9" href="#9"><h2>9</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./9.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>I don&#x27;t know why I took this one, it&#x27;s pointed up too high.</p>
<br>
<a id="10" href="#10"><h2>10</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./10.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>Better.</p>
<br>
<a id="11" href="#11"><h2>11</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./11.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>A very cool crane shot.</p>
<br>
<a id="12" href="#12"><h2>12</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./12.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>Not a great photo, but you can sorta see these ghost artifacts on the pole and
on the concrete. Very weird, very cool.</p>
<br>
<a id="13" href="#13"><h2>13</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./13.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>I love the wobbly glass panes in this one.</p>
<br>
<a id="14" href="#14"><h2>14</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./14.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>Some very nice looking bushes. The cars above are overexposed, but I don&#x27;t mind.</p>
<br>
<a id="15" href="#15"><h2>15</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./15.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>Not a great picture, I just found it interesting that they would put numbers for
each floor on the outside.</p>
<br>
<a id="16" href="#16"><h2>16</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./16.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>A nice cross walk.</p>
<br>
<a id="17" href="#17"><h2>17</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./17.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>A very slanted picture of an intersection.</p>
<br>
<a id="18" href="#18"><h2>18</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./18.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>This was a cool construction site that caught my eye. I just now noticed that there is
a big lamp post in the right of the shot, but oh well.</p>
<br>
<a id="19" href="#19"><h2>19</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./19.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>There was road work happening all the way down this road, and about 10 signs all
lined up. If I moved a bit higher I probably could&#x27;ve gotten a few more signs.</p>
<br>
<a id="20" href="#20"><h2>20</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./20.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>Another bush. This is a very fancy bush in a fancy strip mall with vallet parking,
security guards, and high-end stores for luxury brands like Gucci. We didn&#x27;t exactly
fit in.</p>
<br>
<a id="21" href="#21"><h2>21</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./21.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>More bushes, but near an escalator. This one accidentally lined up nicely with the
left edge of the frame, which was nice.</p>
<br>
<a id="22" href="#22"><h2>22</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./22.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>Still in the fancy strip mall. This one turned out great, I like the mix of curves and
straight lines.</p>
<br>
<a id="23" href="#23"><h2>23</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./23.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>Same construction site from before, but higher up. These porta-potties where sorta the
most eye-catching thing in the frame, so I just decided to make it them the star of the show.</p>
<br>
<a id="24" href="#24"><h2>24</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./24.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>We walked across the highway to go to Uwajimaya. Not a great shot, but I thought I would at least
take one highway shot.</p>
<br>
<a id="25" href="#25"><h2>25</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./25.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>This orange construction sign in the woods caught our eyes, so we went to check it out.
Not much to see.</p>
<br>
<a id="26" href="#26"><h2>26</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./26.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>A random potted plant in the corner of Uwajimaya. Didn&#x27;t know how this one would turn out,
probably could&#x27;ve gotten a bit closer.</p>
<br>
<a id="27" href="#27"><h2>27</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./27.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>This was harder then it looks. There is less than a foot of space between the start of
the mirror and the shelves, so I couldn&#x27;t get a lot of mirror without leaning way in
and making a fool of myself.</p>
<br>
<a id="28" href="#28"><h2>28</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./28.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>A curb outside of the store that looked cool.</p>
<br>
<a id="29" href="#29"><h2>29</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./29.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>My friend.</p>
<br>
<a id="30" href="#30"><h2>30</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./30.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>A cool pedestrian bridge that caught my eye. It turned out great.</p>
<br>
<a id="31" href="#31"><h2>31</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./31.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>My friend again.</p>
<br>
<a id="32" href="#32"><h2>32</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./32.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>An island of grass on an island of asphalt near a highway onramp.</p>
<br>
<a id="33" href="#33"><h2>33</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./33.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>A cool sign with some cool sepia tones.</p>
<br>
<a id="34" href="#34"><h2>34</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./34.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>The same shot as 19 but from across the street. I found it odd that there was this
one-story building on this little plot, surrounded by construction, and a skyline
backdrop behind that.</p>
<br>
<a id="35" href="#35"><h2>35</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./35.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>Looked better in my head.</p>
<br>
<a id="36" href="#36"><h2>36</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./36.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>The last one. Same position as 13 and 14.</p>
<br>
<a id="fin" href="#fin"><h2>Fin</h2></a>
<br>
<p>That&#x27;s it! These pictures turned out a lot better than I expected, which means it
only goes downhill from here. Next time I need to go shooting in manual mode. My camera
did a great job in auto, but I need to figure out what shutter speed to use (I had my
aperture all the way open, so I might want to play with that as well).</p>
