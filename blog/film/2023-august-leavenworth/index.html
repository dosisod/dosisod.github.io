<a id="august-2023-leavenworth-film-shoot" href="#august-2023-leavenworth-film-shoot"><h1>August 2023 Leavenworth Film Shoot</h1></a>
<br>
<p>The first part of this roll is the remainder of my Leavenworth vacation shots,
a few are from my back porch, and the rest are from a hike called Mount Forgotten.
For the most part, this roll was a dud, though I learned a lot, which I will explain
in a bit.</p>
<br>
<p>This was shot on some expired <a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> Kodak Gold 200 film. These rolls only have
24 exposures, which means you need to make the most of each shot. I did not do that.
I am starting to learn that you need to chose the right film stock for the things
you want to shoot: My current approach has been &quot;buy whatever and see what happens&quot;,
but as I learn my camera better I need to be more mindful of the film I use. The
fact that this roll was expired makes it hard to guess what it would look like if
it was brand new, but alas.</p>
<br>
<p>Also, the bright artifacts have made a reappearence. At this point I believe that there
might be a light-leak in my camera. I find it odd that the first roll I did was fine,
but every one since that has been compromised. I need to finish the roll I have in
my camera currently, after which I&#x27;ll probably send it in to get cleaned up and re-sealed.</p>
<br>
<p>Enough prelude, onto the pictures:</p>
<br>
<a id="1-7" href="#1-7"><h2>1-7</h2></a>
<br>
<p>I tried to do some starlight photography, and that turned out to be a disaster.
All the pictures where blown out (the shop didn&#x27;t even bother scanning it).
200 ISO is way too sensitive for what I was trying to do, and I was opening it for
way too long regardless. I assumed because it was pitch black out I could
leave the shutter open for longer, but I was proven wrong. This will be a challenge
for another day.</p>
<br>
<a id="8" href="#8"><h2>8</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./8.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>Probably the best picture of the whole roll. The expired film fits the overall look
of the scene, and the artifacts are hardly visible.</p>
<br>
<a id="9" href="#9"><h2>9</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./9.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>Here is where you start to see the artifacts. They are blue this time instead of white,
which I find interesting. My intuition would tell me that the picture itself would just
be brighter in that region, but instead it&#x27;s bluer. Very odd.</p>
<br>
<a id="10" href="#10"><h2>10</h2></a>
<br>
<p>Redacted because it&#x27;s a picture of my sister and I haven&#x27;t gotten her permission to
post it.</p>
<br>
<a id="11" href="#11"><h2>11</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./11.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>Another good one. The expired film makes the whole frame a bit greener, which ended up
looking decent.</p>
<br>
<a id="12" href="#12"><h2>12</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./12.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>Not a great picture: It&#x27;s blury and out of focus, and the wall is way too blury, which
is only made worse by the artifact gremlins. The picture should&#x27;ve also been vertical
because the window is vertical, but oh well.</p>
<br>
<a id="13" href="#13"><h2>13</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./13.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>Another picture of my front door. I didn&#x27;t stand still enough, so the whole picture is
a bit blury. The reason I took the picture (and the next few pictures from my porch) is
because a rain storm just came through, and there was this really pretty yellow sunset
outside. Either way, the expired film made it more green then yellow, which is annoying.</p>
<br>
<a id="14" href="#14"><h2>14</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./14.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>These next few are from my porch. The background was blury like I wanted it to be, but
the umbrella is not in focus at all (I have a hard time finding the right focus for close
up shots). Any attempt to have a good picture though was nullified by the artifacts.</p>
<br>
<a id="15" href="#15"><h2>15</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./15.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>This one was almost good, minus the artifacts.</p>
<br>
<a id="16" href="#16"><h2>16</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./16.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>This isn&#x27;t very good, even without the artifacts.</p>
<br>
<a id="17" href="#17"><h2>17</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./17.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<a id="18" href="#18"><h2>18</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./18.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>This was at the top of Mount Forgotten. Since I only had a few shots left I went to the top
without taking any pictures, then took all my pictures on my way down. While the mountain
range overall was really pretty, there wasn&#x27;t a single frame that looked really good given
the focal length of my camera.</p>
<br>
<a id="19" href="#19"><h2>19</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./19.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<p>A decent picture (minus the artifacts).</p>
<br>
<a id="20" href="#20"><h2>20</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./20.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<a id="21" href="#21"><h2>21</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./21.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<a id="22" href="#22"><h2>22</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./22.jpg" loading=lazy width=1024 height=1544 />
<br>
<a id="23" href="#23"><h2>23</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./23.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>A not-so-good shot of a waterfall.</p>
<br>
<a id="24" href="#24"><h2>24</h2></a>
<br>
<img src="./24.jpg" loading=lazy width=1544 height=1024 />
<br>
<p>Some algae in this river. I didn&#x27;t capture it very well, but perhaps someone more
experienced could have captured the dark river and the reflections at once.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>As I said, this roll was a bit of a dud. I got some good pictures, and learned a lot
on the way. Some of the big takeaways were:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you&#x27;re using the right film stock for what you&#x27;re shooting.</li>
<li>Take into account what the expired film will do to your shots.</li>
<li>Stand still and focus better.</li>
<li>I need to learn how to properly set the shutter speed and aperture for the more complicated shots.</li>
<li>I need to figure out what is causing these light gremlins to get in my camera.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-ref-1">[1]</a>: I got it for free from a friend who got it from someone else, and it was out
of the box when he got it. It is at least a few years out of date, but it could be
much much longer, I have no idea.</p>
