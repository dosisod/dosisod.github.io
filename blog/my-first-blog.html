  <h1>My First Blog</h1>
  <br>
  <p>
    This is my first, blog, nothing special. I don't know what things look
    will look like in the future, but I guess that is kinda the point.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Here is a short list of what I might want to do in the future:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Make custom markdown to HTML converter so I dont write these things manually</li>
    <li>Thats about it</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You might want to check my <a href="https://github.com/dosisod">GitHub account</a>
    while youre waiting. (I dont do Twitter, Facebook, or anything like that,
    hence the blog).
