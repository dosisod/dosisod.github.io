<br>
<p>I don&#x27;t like JavaScript, or, more accurately, I try to avoid it whenever possible.</p>
<br>
<p><a href="./film/2023-july-bellevue/index.html">In my most recent blog</a> though I ran into an
issue where I needed to load a bunch of images (36, it was from a film shoot),
and doing so up front would be very inefficient. The best option would be to lazy-load
the images, but from what I have experienced, this required JavaScript.</p>
<br>
<p>Me being the JavaScript unenthusiast I am I looked up if there was a way to do this
in plain HTML. Turns out you can, and it&#x27;s really easy!</p>
<br>
<pre class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">img</span> <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;some_image.png&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-attr">loading</span>=<span class="hljs-string">lazy</span> /&gt;</span></pre>

<br>
<p>And that&#x27;s it! Well, not quite.</p>
<br>
<p>The first time I did this it immediately loaded 28 of the 36 images, which was not what
I expected. Turns out that when you don&#x27;t specify an image size the browser has no idea
how big the image is, and thus how big the viewport is.</p>
<br>
<p>To fix this, hard-code the size of the image:</p>
<br>
<pre class="hljs"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">img</span> <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;some_image.png&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-attr">width</span>=<span class="hljs-string">1920</span> <span class="hljs-attr">height</span>=<span class="hljs-string">1080</span> <span class="hljs-attr">loading</span>=<span class="hljs-string">lazy</span> /&gt;</span></pre>

<br>
<p>And now your images should load at a more modest rate.</p>
<br>
<a id="next-steps" href="#next-steps"><h2>Next Steps</h2></a>
<br>
<p>Since I am getting into film more I&#x27;m looking into experimenting more with different
loading techniques. I know that there image attributes called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/srcset"><code class="hljs">srcset</code>s</a>
that change the image based on the size of the screen, which would be good for mobile (and, no JavaScript!).</p>
<br>
<p>Another (albeit unrelated) technique that I want to explore is <a href="https://blurha.sh/">Blurhashes</a>.
They are basically very approximate gradients that look like the blurred version of the
image you want to look at. If I had some sort of pay walled app or dynamic image loading
feature I would find this really useful, though I doubt I will have a concrete need for it
anytime soon.</p>
