<br>
<p>Last night I watched <em>The Creator</em>, and on the ride home my dad and I talked about
some of the future implications of AI. Afterwards I thought some more, and decided it
would be fun to jot down some of my feelings towards AI as a whole.</p>
<br>
<p>These are in no way &quot;new&quot; thoughts - most of it has been said in one way or another -
but alas I want to ramble and put my ideas out there.</p>
<br>
<p>In no particular order...</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The line between &quot;algorithm&quot; and &quot;AI&quot; is hard to determine, and is often conflated.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>AI can, is, and will be used to fabricate evidence.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The potential for evidence to be fabricated using AI will be used to cast doubt on actual evidence.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>&quot;AI&quot; is not one singular thing, but a loose term that can be applied to any &quot;highly complex&quot; algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Regulating AI is hard, if not impossible.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>We (the consumers) were responsible for freely feeding and training these AI systems.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>We (the consumers) are responsible for using/paying for/supporting companies that don&#x27;t harm us going forwards.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>AI systems that aren&#x27;t connected to the internet (or robots with arms and legs) can&#x27;t take over the world.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>AI systems that aren&#x27;t connected to the internet can still cause serious harm (spam, blackmail, deepfakes, etc).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>AI makes it hard to know what you&#x27;re seeing online is real or fake.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Not using AI or LLMs for your writing gives you FOMO for those who are.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>When it comes to writing, AI/LLMs are becoming the lowest common denominator in regards to grammar, spelling, and so forth.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The proclaimed benefiets of AI makes others get suckered into adopting it.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>AI itself is not a problem, it&#x27;s the people who make it that we need to worry about.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Who&#x27;s really asking for AI?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>AI does not mark the end of algorithms, it&#x27;s just another algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>AI is not always the right tool for the job.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes AI is the most incorrect, dangerous, and idiotic tool for the job.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Many AI systems are highly unoptimized and inefficient.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Rampant adoption of AI (especially inefficient AI systems) will significant increase global power usage.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Rampant adoption of AI will significant increase globalization.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>AI should make you question what it means to be human.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>AI generated music will probably become mainstream.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>You cannot rely on AI to secure itself, you need external checks and balances.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>AI is scary.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>AI is mysterious.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>AI is going to be in the news for a while.</li>
</ul>
