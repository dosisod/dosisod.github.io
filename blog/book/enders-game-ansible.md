# How Would an Ansible Work? (Ender's Game)

I finished reading Ender's Game a while ago, but this lingering thought has
been bouncing around in my head for a while: How would the ansible described
in Ender's Game actually work?

> Potential spoilers ahead.

## Ansible?

For those of you who haven't read Ender's Game, the ansible is a machine which
is capable of sending/receiving data at/nearly at the speed of light. It allows
for communication across vast distances, which is super useful for space-bearing
civilizations.

## The Problem

In the book, while Ender is traveling around on a spaceship, he is able to talk
to his brother on Earth. Due to relativity, Peter (his brother) ages faster
relative to Ender, and dies while Ender is still young.

With that in mind, what would a zoom call look like over ansible?
If you have a constant stream of communication between 2 parties, were both
parties experience time differently relative to eachother, would one experience
it in slo-mo? Would one be faster then the other? Would the communication itself
slow down or speed up to "sync" with the time relative to the person receiving
the message?

## The Solution?

This technology can't exist (probably), so trying to rationalize it in terms of
our current understanding of physics is futile.

In the book, we only came across this technology because the aliens brought it
to us. It goes without saying, but there is a very low probability that we
would've came up with something similar for a very long time.

The best (and only) solution is to ponder the cool ways we might use such a technology,
knowing that we almost certainly will never be able to use it.
