<br>
<p>I finished reading Ender&#x27;s Game a while ago, but this lingering thought has
been bouncing around in my head for a while: How would the ansible described
in Ender&#x27;s Game actually work?</p>

<a id="ansible" href="#ansible"><h2>Ansible?</h2></a>
<br>
<p>For those of you who haven&#x27;t read Ender&#x27;s Game, the ansible is a machine which
is capable of sending/receiving data at/nearly at the speed of light. It allows
for communication across vast distances, which is super useful for space-bearing
civilizations.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>Note that the term &quot;ansible&quot; has been around before Ender&#x27;s Game was written,
so we are just use Ender&#x27;s Game as a reference.</blockquote>

<a id="the-problem" href="#the-problem"><h2>The Problem</h2></a>
<br>
<p>In the book, while Ender is traveling around on a spaceship, he is able to talk
to his brother on Earth. Due to relativity, Peter (his brother) ages faster
relative to Ender, and dies while Ender is still young.</p>
<br>
<p>With that in mind, what would a zoom call look like over ansible?
If you have a constant stream of communication between 2 parties, were both
parties experience time differently relative to eachother, would one experience
it in slo-mo? Would one be faster then the other? Would the communication itself
slow down or speed up to &quot;sync&quot; with the time relative to the person receiving
the message?</p>
<br>
<a id="the-solution" href="#the-solution"><h2>The Solution?</h2></a>
<br>
<p>This technology can&#x27;t exist (probably), so trying to rationalize it in terms of
our current understanding of physics is futile.</p>
<br>
<p>In the book, we only came across this technology because the aliens brought it
to us. It goes without saying, but there is a very low probability that we
would&#x27;ve came up with something similar for a very long time.</p>
<br>
<p>The best (and only) solution is to ponder the cool ways we might use such a technology,
knowing that we almost certainly will never be able to use it.</p>
