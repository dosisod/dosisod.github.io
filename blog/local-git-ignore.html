<br>
<p>This is a very small tip on how to cleanup your <code class="hljs">.gitignore</code> files.</p>
<br>
<p>Usually you just add everything that you want to ignore from version control into the <code class="hljs">.gitignore</code> file,
and all is well. But what happens when you want to ignore a certain file or folder, and it only applies to your current
setup, or your current IDE? You shouldn&#x27;t need to pollute the <code class="hljs">.gitignore</code> file in version control because
you want to hide something locally.</p>
<br>
<p>To fix this, look no further then the <code class="hljs">.git/info/exclude</code> file! If you <code class="hljs">cat</code> it out, it will explain itself:</p>
<br>
<pre class="hljs"># git ls-files --others --exclude-from=.git/info/exclude
# Lines that start with &#x27;#&#x27; are comments.
# For a project mostly in C, the following would be a good set of
# exclude patterns (uncomment them if you want to use them):
# *.[oa]
# *~</pre>
<br>
<p>Just like your <code class="hljs">.gitignore</code>, just add a line for each file you want to ignore, and only your system will be affected!</p>
<br>
<p>As an added bonus, if there is a list of files you want to hide (locally) across many projects, you can
add them to your <code class="hljs">~/.config/git/ignore</code> file instead!</p>
