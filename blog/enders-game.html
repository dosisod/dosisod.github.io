<h1>Ender's Game Book / Movie Review</h1>
<br>
<p>Warning, this contains spoilers!</p>
<br>
<p>Before I begin, I should say that I watched the movie in theaters when it
first came out, and have only just now gotten around to finishing it. While
reading, I tried to imagine that I had not watched the movie, and was reading
the book for the first time. My memory of the movie is pretty fuzzy, so this
was pretty doable for the most part.</p>
<br>
<p>I will compare what I remember from the movie to the book near the end.</p>
<br>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<br>
<p>Basically, the world was attacked by aliens (twice), and so a governing
body, the IF (international fleet) is formed, which was designed to protect
Earth from the "buggers" (the aliens). The IF decided it would be best
to start sending literal toddlers into battle school, where they would
learn to fight and develop strategies. After battle school, they would
go to pre-command school (in Ender's case, command school), where they
would learn to command entire enemy ships in simulators. To no one's
surprise, Ender defeats the buggers at the end.</p>
<br>
<p>There is a lot of really important details that I am skipping over. Really,
you need to read the book!</p>
<br>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<br>
<p>There are a lot of good things to say about this book, which is a good thing!</p>
<br>
<h3>Easy to understand</h3>
<br>
<p>I found that this was super easy to read, and that most of what was said
stuck. Not all sci-fi books have to be a dense and complicated jungle
of theory and metaphors.</p>
<br>
<p>The major plot points are easy to pick up: for example, when Ender is moved
from place to place tells you something major has/is happening.</p>
<br>
<h3>Touched on many interesting sci-fi topics</h3>
<br>
<p>One of the coolest parts of the book for me was the Ansible, this machine
which was capable of transmitting information instantaneously across any
distance. In a similar vein, the fact that the "buggers" are a hive mind
species who don't have the ability to read/write/speak is super interesting,
and probably one of my favorite parts of the whole book.</p>
<br>
<h3>Had good, meaningful characters</h3>
<br>
<p>Ender, Valentine, and Peter all where solid characters. You really felt the
villainy in Peter, and the loving sisterly-compassion in Valentine (ironic).
Bonzo also was a great character, and the build-up to his eventual death
was quite something. Every character had a clear purpose and meaning to the
story, even if they just had a small part.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<br>
<h3>Ending felt a bit rushed</h3>
<br>
<p>I am specifically talking about the epilogue which introduced the concept
of the speakers for the dead. It was very interesting, but felt like it
was slapped on at the end, and told in a matter-of-fact attitude. Again,
I didn't hate it, I just thought it could've been introduced more gradually.
There where plenty of indications that Ender felt for the buggers, so it
wasn't completely unexpected.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Ugly</h2>
<br>
<h3>Lack of imagery</h3>
<br>
<p>A lot of the scenes where not as descriptive as they could've been. A lot was
left to the imagination, and perhaps this was the point. Perhaps me already
seeing the movie set the bar for how the scenes where supposed to be, and the
book not describing things with such visual clarity should've been expected.</p>
<br>
<h2>Movie Comparisons</h2>
<br>
<p>For starters, the whole romance thing with Petra did not exist in the
book.</p>
<br>
<p>Another thing is that the actors are much older then portrayed in the
book, though this is somewhat expected given how young they are in the book.
Ender is six when he first goes to battle school, and 11 when he defeats the
buggers (I believe).</p>
<br>
<p>One of the things the movie did better was the scenes where Ender was in the
Giant game, and the command school simulations. The surreality of the Giant
game shown on a big screen was great to see, and the full-blown simulations
in the command school where so much better then the little colored shapes
portrayed in the book.</p>
<br>
<p>One of the small details that was different was the events that took place
in the shower fight. The movie made it seem like Ender was more remorseful,
though in the book he went all out, like he did on Stilton. If I recall
correctly, they also did not mention that the Stilton and Bonzo where killed
in the movie, though I might be wrong about that.</p>
<br>
<p>Also, Harrison Ford was casted as Colonel Graff, which was pretty cool. Lots
of people say that his performance was lacking, though I remember him being
a pretty stone-walled character in the book. Perhaps I should re-watch the
movie.</p>
<br>
<h2>Should you read it?</h2>
<br>
<p>Yes.</p>
<br>
<p>The ideas and plot points in the book are really good, and a good book to
cross off any sci-fi lovers book list. The fact that they also made a movie
about it tells you that the book must've been good (or that they wanted to
turn it into a franchise, who knows).</p>
<br>
<p>Ender's Game, and it's sequel, Speaker for the Dead, both won the Nebula
Award for Best Novel in the years 1986 and 1987 respectively. There are
so many classic Nebula Award winners, like Dune and Neuromancer. If you
liked either of those, you might like Ender's Game as well (I have yet to
read Neuromancer though).</p>
<br>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<br>
<p>My friend told me that there are many stories in this universe, and many ways
to read the books. For example, Ender's Shadow is a book that takes place at
the same time as Ender's Game, but from the perspective of Bean. This might
be something to keep in mind if you are wanting to read the book(s) for the
first time.</p>
<br>
<p>All in all, a good book, and I can't wait to read the sequel!</p>
